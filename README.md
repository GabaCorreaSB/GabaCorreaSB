# Hey! ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my Github profile!

#### My name is Gabriel Correa, also known as Gaba, and I am a Software Engineer. Previously, I worked as a Network Analyst, specializing in LGPD (General Data Protection Law) and the automation of local infrastructure. My foray into infrastructure as code was a pivotal moment, sparking my interest in Software Engineering. This shift was driven by a desire to delve deeper into the engineering lifestyle and to hone my coding skills.

#### My passion for programming ignited during my college years. I initially dabbled in coding for basic college assignments, but it wasn't long before I started using these skills to automate many tasks in my Network Analyst role. This practical application of coding in a professional context propelled me towards a more profound understanding of software development. My journey began with C++ for IoT (Internet of Things) projects, which naturally led me to explore shell scripting and eventually Python.

#### Having developed a solid foundation in Python, shell scripting, and C++, I began to channel my knowledge into creating projects. These projects reflect my growing expertise and can be viewed on my GitHub profile, showcasing a blend of my academic learnings and professional experiences in the field of Software Engineering.
