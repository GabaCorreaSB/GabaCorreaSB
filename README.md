# Hey! ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my Github profile!

#### My name is Gabriel Correa AKA Gaba and I'm a Software Engineer. I used to work as a Network Analyst, with focus on LGPD and automating local infrastructure. When I started working on infrastructure as code something just clicked and I had to start my journey towards Software Engineering, to be able to learn more about the life of an Engineer and of course learning to properly code. 

#### I've became very passionate about programming as I was going through college years. Started coding in basic college assignments but in no time I began to automate most of my duties as a Network Analyst, which helped me go after learning how to properly code and how to make a life out of it. Began with C++ for IoT, and then got a feeling for shell scripting, which led me to python. ;D

#### After achieving a reasonable understanding at python, shell and C++ I started to create projects, some of which can be found here at my github.
