# Hey! ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my Github profile!

#### My name is Gabriel Correa AKA Gaba. I'm a Computer Engineering student, currently at the 10th and last period. I used to work as a Networking Analyst, with focus on LGPD and automating local infrastructure. When I started to apply infrastructure as code I had the urge to start my journey towards Software Engineering, to be able to learn more about the life of an Engineer. 

#### I've became very passionate about programming as I was going through college years. Started coding in basic college assignments but in no time I began to automate most of my duties as a Networking Analyst, which helped me go after learning how to properly code and how to make a life out of it. Began with C++ for IoT, and then got a feeling for shell scripting, which led me to python. ;D

#### After I had achieved a reasonable understanding at python, shell and C++ I started to create projects, some of which can be found here at my github. After I had coded only for personal projects I did what I wanted and started my life as a Software Engineer.
